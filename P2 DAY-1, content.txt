Lambda function:
----------------
->it is called as anonymous function.
->when we want use function concept,but without using function 
name there we use lambda function.

four pillars of oops:
---------------------

1. abstraction:

==> hiding the implementation part showing only what is
 required for users.
 ex: exe file.
==>we can make class or method as abstract,opposite to 
abstract is concrete.

2. encapsulation:

==>binding data and function into a single entity.
==>public---low level data protection---one class info 
can be accessed by any other class
==>private---medium level dp---can used where it is 
declared/no in inheritected class
==>protected---high level dp---can be accessed only where it 
got declared...whichever class inherited from this class 
there also we can use.

3. inheritances:

==>base class and derived class
==>derived class will inherit properties of base class
==>ex: base class---parent
       derived class---child
		
			types of inheritance:
			------------------
			1. single inheritance
			2. multiple inheritance
			3. multi-level inheritance
			4. hierarchical inheritance
			5. hybrid inheritance

4. polymorphism:
